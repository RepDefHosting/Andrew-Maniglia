pageTitle: Andrew Maniglia Christmas Tree
metaDescription: While in his last year of college and while playing in a
  Club/Show Band (Sounds Unlimited), Mr. Maniglia composed several commercial
  jingles and arranged numerous more songs for various commercial entities. His
  greatest success came with the composition of a jingle that was incorporated
  into a national campaign for a greeting card company in 1979. Andrew Maniglia
  wears many hats and shares his talents. He most certainly does not bury them
  in the ground. He continues to compose and arrange on a weekly basis. Most of
  his compositions are now for the Catholic Church.
